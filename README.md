<h2>About</h2>

<p>Single cell RNA-seq data exhibit large numbers of zero count values, that as demonstrated in our <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.444841v2">paper</a>, for a subset of transcripts, be better modelled by a zero inflated negative binomial distribution.
We develop a novel Dirichlet process mixture model which employs both a mixture at the cell level to model multiple cell types, and a mixture of single cell RNA-seq counts at the transcript level to model the transcript specific zero-inflation of counts.
It is shown that this approach outperforms previous approaches that applied multinomial distributions to model single cell RNA-seq counts, and also performs better or comparably to existing top performing methods.
By taking a Bayesian approach we are able to build interpretable models of expression within clusters, and to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignments.
Applied to a publicly available data set of single cell RNA-seq counts of multiple cell types from the mouse cortex and hippocampus, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to distinguish sub-populations of cells as clusters in the data, and to identify gene sets that are indicative of membership of a sub-population.
The methodology is implemented as an open source Snakemake pipeline hosted on this repository.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

After running the pipeline, the following graphs are produced allowing the results of clustering by the Bayesian nonparametric zero-inflated negative binomial model to be interpreted:

<details open="open">
	<summary><b>UMAP</b></summary>

All cells are projected onto a 2D plane through UMAP embeddings of their gene expression allowing the clusters assigned by the model to be visualised.

</details>

<details open="open">
	<summary><b>Cluster Means</b></summary>
	
For each cluster, an interactive graph is produced plotting the mean gene expression within that cluster against the mean expression across all clusters. This allows the identification of genes with unusual expression within the discovered sub-populations of cells.
	
> These graphs are created under the directory results/{data}_exp

<details open="open">
	<summary><b>g:Profiler</b></summary>
	
For the up and down regulated genes within each cluster, the results of gene set enrichment analysis with gprofiler2 are presented through interactive Manhattan plots.
This enables the identification of significantly enriched biological functions and pathways from well established sources such as Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG.
